->It is an open-source object-relational database managment system.
->allow to store, process and retrieve data safely.

1. To install Postgresql 
	-> Sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

2. To go into postgres
	->sudo -u postgres psql
	
3. To check version :- select version();
	-> 12.13
	
4. To check services:-
	-> service postgresql
	
5. For status :-
	-> service postgresql status.
	
6. Postgres Commands :-
	\l               - List of databases.
	\du              - List of users.
	\c database_name - To go and switch database.
	\t or \dt        - List the tables or relations.
	\d table_name    - Describe the table.
	\t               - used to on/off the column names.
	
	
					ALL ABOUT USER
	
7. Go to root user :-
	-> sudo su postgres
	
8. Change password of user :-
	-> ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD "changeit";
	
9. Create new user :-
	-> CREATE USER sachin WITH PASSWORD "changeit";
	
10. Make user as superuser :-
	-> ALTER USER sachin WITH SUPERUSER:
	
11. Remove user :-
	-> DROP USER sachin;
	
					DATA TYPE
					
12. Benefits of Data type:-
	Consistency − Operations against columns of same data type give consistent results and are usually the fastest.

	Validation  − Proper use of data types implies format validation of data and rejection of data outside the scope of data type.

	Compactness − As a column can store a single type of value, it is stored in a compact way.

	Performance − Proper use of data types gives the most efficient storage of data. The values stored can be processed quickly, 			      which enhances the performance.
