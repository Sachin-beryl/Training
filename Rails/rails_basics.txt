------------------------------------------------------------ Rails basics -----------------------------------------------------------------

 1). What is Rails?
	-> An extremely productive web-application framework.
	-> You could develop a web application at least ten times faster with Rails than you could with a typical Java framework.
	-> An open source Ruby framework for developing database-backed web applications.
	-> Configure your code with Database Schema.
	-> No compilation phase required.
	
	latest version -> rails 7.0.4.3
	
 2). Full Stack Framework :-
	-> Includes everything needed to create a database-driven web application, using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
	-> Being a full-stack framework means all the layers are built to work seamlessly together with less code.
	-> Requires fewer lines of code than other frameworks.
	
 3). Three environments :-
	-> Rails gives you three default environments: development, testing, and production. 
	-> Each behaves slightly differently, making your entire software development cycle easier.
	
 4). Rails installation :-
 
 	a). To install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:
		-> gem install rails      # automatically install latest version.

	b). To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following in a new terminal:
		-> rails --version
		
 5). Creating new application :-
 
 	-> rails new application_name     #it will create application with sql database
 	
 	-> rails new application_name -d postgresql    #it will create application with specified database.
 	
 	-> Setup config for database.yml :-

		in <project-name>/config/database.yml

		uncomment and edit the information ,
		database :
		username :
		password :
		host :
		port :
	 	
 6). start the web server :-
 	-> you need to start a web server on your development machine. 
 	-> You can do this by running the following command in the blog directory:
 	
 		-> rails server or rails s
