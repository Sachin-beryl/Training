------------------------------------------------------------- hr-mitra ---------------------------------------------------------------

 step1 :- Create Application:-
 	
 	-> Type in terminal
 	   a). application                  
 	   	:- rails new hr-mitra(application_name)
 	   	
 	   b). move to project folder         
 	   	:- bundle install
 	   	
 	   c). open project folder in vscode  
 	   	:- code .   
 	   	
 	   d). start rails server
 	   	:- rails server or rails s
 	   	
 step2:- Creating custome controller in Rails.
 
 	-> work of controller
 		:- sense request from browser.
 		:- produce appropriate output.
 		
 	NOTE :- MVC works in App dir.
 	
 	a). app/controller
 		*). basics
 			:- Every controller must be inherited by ActionController::Base
 			:- controller file should be with proper naming
 				eg :- home_controller.rb
 				
 		*). Action methods
 			:- it is similer to plain ruby method but when we make it in controller then it is refer as "action".
 			:- when method present in controller and have routing then that method is called as action.
 			
 				:- In home_controller
 					class HomeController < ActionController::Base
					  def index        #action
					  end
					end
					
 			:- if you want to create method, which is not action then it must be private
 				
 				eg:-
 					private
 					def method
 					end
 					 
 	b). app/config/routes.rb
 		*). basics
 			i).   get -> when we want to retrive data.
 			ii).  post -> when to save resource on server first time.
 			iii). delete -> when to delete resource from server.
 			iv).  patch -> when to insert and update in existing resource. 
 			
 		use of get :-
 			1 way). get 'home/index'     #home is a controller name , index is a action method. (127.0.0.1/home/index)
 			2 way). get '/home' => 'home#index'       # (127.0.0.1/home)
 			
 		NOTE :- 406 error ,when no template(html)
 		     :- 200 when request successfully served.
 		     
 	c). app/views
 	
 		-> used to show content on browser. (means html,css etc content)
 		
 		a). Create dir with same name as controller name (home_controller)
 			:- dir id home
 			
 		b). move to app/views/home
 			-> now create html file with same name of action.
 				:- index.html.erb
 				
 			-> In index file.
 				:- <h1> Hello world </h1>
 				   <p> I am learning rails! </p>
