------------------------------------------------------ Active Record Associations -----------------------------------------------------

 -> In Rails, an association is a connection between two Active Record models.
 
 ****************************** NOTE :- using below two association, to make one to many relation. ************************************
 
 (**) before adding association :-
 
 	1). first make model and enter data for that table.
 	
 	    :- rails g model book name book_type   #if we not specify the type opf column it will take string.
 	    
 	    -> data enter in book table
 	    	:- Book.create([{name: "The Hobbit ", book_type: "Fantasy"},{name: "And Then There Were None", book_type: "Mystery"}
 	    	,{name: "The Little Prince", book_type: "Adventure"},{name: "A Tale Of Two Cities", book_type: "fiction"}])

 (**) After adding association
 
	2). Now add association :-
 	    
	    :- rails g model author name book:references    # it will automatically generate belongs_to association in author.
	    
	    -> check in app/model/author.rb
	    	:-     class Author < ApplicationRecord
			  belongs_to :book                  # belongs_to always use singular model name.
			end
		
	    -> create manual has_many association in book.rb
	   	:-	class Book < ApplicationRecord
			  has_many :authors		     # has_many always use plural model name.
			end
			
	     a). now enter the data for author table.
	     
	     	:- Author.create([{name: "JRR Tolkien", book_id: 2},{name: "Agatha Christie", book_id: 3},{name: "Antoine de Saint
	     	-ExupÃ©ry", book_id: 4},{name: "Charles Dickens", book_id: 5},{name: "Charles Dickens", book_id: 3}])


  practise on console :-
  
  	*). save book one row into variable.
  		:- b1 = Book.find(3)
  		
  	*). for check author detail related to 3rd id book. 
  		:- b1.authors
  		
  output:- showing one book have two author  (one-2-many)
  
        Author Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "authors".* FROM "authors" WHERE "authors"."book_id" = $1  [["book_id", 3]]
	=>                                                              
	[#<Author:0x00007f2c814e91c0                              
	  id: 3,                                                  
	  name: "Agatha Christie",                                
	  book_id: 3,
